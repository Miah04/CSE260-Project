NOTES:

* Open-source libraries from "https://www.theengineeringprojects.com/" were used 
  for the components that were not included among the pre-installed library of 
  Proteus 8 Professional.

* "LIBRARY FILES" is the folder containing the library files of the modules used.
  Please copy them onto the Proteus Library of your computer before testing.
  Default location: "C:\Program Files (x86)\Labcenter Electronics\Proteus 8 Professional\DATA\LIBRARY"
  Use your version of Proteus instead of "Proteus 8 Professional" in case your 
  version is different.

* "260 Project.pdsprj" is the proteus project file containing the setup. Please 
  copy the Library files before opening this file in proteus. Next, you will have 
  to select the necessary HEX files for Arduino uno board (ARD1), Flame sensor 
  (FLAME1) and Infrared obstacle sensor (IR1).

* "HEX files" folder contains the necessary HEX files for the Proteus components -
  "CSE260_Alarm_Project.ino.HEX"  -  for arduino uno board
  "FlameSensorTEP.HEX"  -  for the flame sensor module
  "InfraredSensorsTEP.HEX"  - for the infrared sensor module

* "CSE260_Alarm_Project" folder contains the Arduino code and the hex file 
  created from that code.
